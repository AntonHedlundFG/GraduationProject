The project will be an online multiplayer, rogue-lite game, which also lends a lot of elements from the tactical rpg genre. The game will be turn based and takes place on a grid based board of interconnected rooms which is generated from a random seed. Players will control one or more units. These units will be able to progress and grow stronger through finding “power-ups” in the usual rogue-lite style. The game will use a command pattern for unit actions and pass those along for replication through the networking. The character progression, commands, as well as the seed for all the random generation will be able to be saved locally by the hosting player.

The project will be 10 weeks long and the team will consist of 4-5 programmers. For the project we will be using C++ in Unreal Engine 5, while relying on Hazelight’s Angelscript for gameplay programming.

We have drawn inspiration from various different sources depending on the system in question. For the board based gameplay we have taken inspiration from the gameplay patterns of tabletop games like Descent and Warhammer: Quest. When it comes to the rogue-lite elements we want a “random encounter” system like the one found in games like FTL: Faster Than Light, while we imagine using a similar power-up system to Risk of Rain 2 or The Binding of Isaac. Finally some other early points of inspiration were tactical role playing games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Baldur’s Gate 3 (or Dungeons and Dragons in general).
